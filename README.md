> Examples of tests that mock Node system APIs: fs, http, child_process, timers

Practical working test examples for blog post
[Mock system APIs](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/mock-system-apis/).
Because mocking the *stable, well documented* Node system APIs is easier
than stubbing your own internal code. And simpler to update in the future!

## Examples

* [ ] mocking file system
* [ ] mocking network request
* [ ] mocking `child_process.spawn`
* [ ] mocking `child_procesa.exec`
* [ ] mocking `setTimeout` with fake timer
